It is a well known fact that every student living in a student house has a problem with cleaning.
It is hard to keep track of who is doing what in the house. Because of this students tend to neglect
their cleaning responsibilities. With the new app Clean Student this is no more! 
In Clean Student, a user can invite his roommates into a group in which he can assign rooms 
in the house to users of the group. In each room a list of tasks can be created which can be checked of.
Other users can see who has done what and when.
