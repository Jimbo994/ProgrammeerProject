**StudentenSchoonmaakApp**

Everyone that is or has been a student or has lived in a house with several people must agree that cleaning is a disaster.
If you clean there is a big chance some one else will make a big mess in the house. Because you feel you are the only one cleaning,
you stop cleaning. And because of this the average house is a mess. 
The StudentenSchooonmaakApp is the solution to this!

**Benefits for the User**

The User will have insight in what has to be done to clean their household as well as being able to track what their housemates are doing.
Because of this the group will be more motivated to do their cleaning.

**Similar apps** <br>
There are apps in the play store at the moment that focus on delegating and planning cleaning tasks in households.
Some well developed apps are ChoreMonster and OurHome (see URL), but these focus on getting children to do chores in the house.
By doing this they can earn points to get rewards from their parents. This is not what I want to do with my app, although it might be nice to implement a scoreboard for students completing their tasks in time or punishments for those who don't.

Then there is Cleanapps which is in my, perhaps short-sighted, opinion more of a to do list.
Lastly there is a app called ChoreList which is a more advanced version of CleanApps with some additional functions. 
But it does not support the use of user groups and I feel that the design and UI are not really eye-catching.

Another app which targets students is WieBetaaltWat. It is an app where you can make a group (by inviting people by e-mail) where you can load your receipts. With this information the app calculates the expends made by you and your groupmembers. The goals of this app is to make it clear who spends money on what so the users can equilibrate on money. What I like about this app is that the design is simple, yet visually attractive, and it works great. I hope to be able to make use of this in my application as well. Also the ability of making groups is really interesting for my app.

**Necessities & Complications**
This app will need a database to store information of users, groups and tasks of these groups. Also multiple users of the same group should be able to acces this data. This will be a big challenge to overcome and perhaps the biggest. I am planning on using FireBase as a database and on first sight it seems that FireBase supports the problem I face. 

WieBetaaltWat makes uses of account activition using email and also inviting other people by sending email. I would really like it if my app had this possibility as well. But I do not know how I can implement this yet. This is going to be a problem as well.
