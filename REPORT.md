The goal of Clean Student is that a user can keep track of the cleaning of his house together with his housemates.
In this Android app a user can set up a group by inviting his housemates by e-mail. Once a group is created rooms can be created and
can be assigned to members of the group. In these respective rooms a list of tasks can be created. Which can be marked on completion, so that groupmembers can see what is done and when.
